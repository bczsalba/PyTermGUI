#### After v1.0.0:

- `major`: feature theme
- `minor`: lesser additions under the same feature theme
- `patch`: fixes for `minor` versions, no new features

## Upcoming Version

- 1.0.0 - First stable release!

  - [x] Fix mouse handling selection
  - [o] Fix macro only running once
  - [ ] Fix linebreak method splitting colors
  - [ ] Fix `SIGWINCH` handling (see GH issue)
  - [ ]? Change MouseTarget callback signature -> `parent: Widget, caller: Widget`

  - [x] Rework `Widget.click()`

    - [x] targets should be found using `Widget.get_target()`
    - [x] **MouseEvent should be sent to the widget-specific mouse handler.**
      - [x] `Widget.handle_mouse(event: MouseEvent, target: Optional[MouseTarget]) -> bool`
      - [x] This method can then split off into various handlers for all actions

  - [x] Rewrite `WindowManager`

    - The current implementation is old and rushed, with a lot of shortcuts.

  - [x] Add `handle_mouse` method to `Widget`
  - [x] Add `handle_key` method to `Widget`

  - [x] Rework width & height systems
    - [x] instead of `forced_width`, there should be a combination of an overflow & a size policy
    - [x] overflow/expand -> current no forced width behaviour
    - [x] overflow/clip -> shorten lines to fit width

  * [ ] some kind of measurement system:

    - `Widget.measurements` property: `(min, max)`

    * [x] Fix long-standing issues
      - [x] inner-container mouse selection is buggy

  * [-] `cmd` helper menu is broken -- problem temporarily ignored
  * [x] inner-container keyboard selection ends outer container
  * [ ] `Container` and `WindowManager` both resize `Window` on `SIGWINCH`

* [x] Add JSON config parsing
* [x] add background styles

## Future versions

- 2.0.0 - The stylish update!

  - [ ] Add color methods
    - [ ] gradient (`[<@141]`, `[<141]`, `[>@141]`, `get_gradient(including: int)`)
    - [ ] complement (`get_complement(color: int)`)

  * [ ] Add support for newlines in break_line

  - [ ] make `MarkupFormatter` more dynamic:
    - [ ] there should be a way you can incorporate depth information into a code
    - [ ] this needs parser support however
    - [ ] e.g.: `[@{30 + {depth} * 36}]this is a gradient of depth`

- unnamed _(order irrelevant)_

  - [ ] `WindowManager` tiling layout

  * [ ] maybe make `MarkupFormatter` serializable?

  * [ ] maybe clean up how Widget "enum" attributes are written
